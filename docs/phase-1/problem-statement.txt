Project: Salesforce Personal Finance Manager (PFM)

Problem:
Individuals lack a single, Salesforce-powered solution to track incomes, expenses, recurring bills, budgets and savings goals with timely insights. 
Many users struggle to categorize transactions, forecast cashflow, and receive simple actionable advice.

PFM is a Salesforce app that:
- Captures transactions (manual & CSV import)
- Tracks accounts, budgets, recurring bills, and goals
- Provides dashboards for cashflow and savings progress
- Sends notifications for low balance / upcoming bills
- Offers an AI chatbot to answer "Where can I reduce spend?" and "How much can I save monthly?"

Phase 1 Deliverables (in repo under docs/phase-1):
- Requirement gathering (stakeholder-analysis.md)
- Business process map (business-process-map.md)
- Use cases (use-cases.md)
