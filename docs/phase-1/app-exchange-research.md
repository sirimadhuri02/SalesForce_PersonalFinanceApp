# AppExchange Research Notes

**Project:** Salesforce Personal Finance Manager (PFM)

### Objective
To research the Salesforce AppExchange for existing Personal Finance Management (PFM) or similar solutions to identify competitors, market gaps, and potential features to adopt or avoid.

### Research Findings

- **General Observation:** There are a limited number of comprehensive PFM apps for individual use on the Salesforce AppExchange. Most financial apps are B2B (Business-to-Business) focused on wealth management, banking, or corporate finance.

- **Example 1: "FinanciallyMinded" (Fictional)**
  - **Focus:** Wealth management for financial advisors.
  - **Strengths:** Strong reporting, integration with investment platforms.
  - **Weaknesses:** Not designed for individual end-users, complex setup, lacks features like budget tracking and recurring bill management.
  - **Relevance to PFM Project:** Confirms a gap in the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) PFM space. Our solution will target this unmet need.

- **Example 2: "Budget Buddy" (Fictional)**
  - **Focus:** Simple budget tracking for small businesses.
  - **Strengths:** Straightforward UI, good for basic expense categorization.
  - **Weaknesses:** No support for personal savings goals, recurring bills, or AI-driven insights. It is not mobile-first.
  - **Relevance to PFM Project:** We can adopt a simple budget tracking UI but must differentiate by adding personal goals, recurring bills, and an AI chatbot.

### Conclusion
The research confirms a significant market opportunity for a Salesforce-based B2C PFM application. Existing solutions are either too complex (B2B wealth management) or too basic (simple budget trackers). Our proposed solution, with its focus on a comprehensive feature set for individual users and an AI chatbot for insights, is well-positioned to fill this gap.
